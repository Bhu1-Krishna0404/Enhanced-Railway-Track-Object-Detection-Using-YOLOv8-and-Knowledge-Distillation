# Enhanced-Railway-Track-Object-Detection-Using-YOLOv8-and-Knowledge-Distillation
This project presents an efficient two-stage deep learning pipeline for real-time detection of foreign objects on railway tracks. By combining a lightweight image classification network with YOLOv8 and knowledge distillation, it enhances both speed and accuracy, aiming to prevent accidents and ensure rail safety.
